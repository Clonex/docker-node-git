### Dynamically Pulling code from git
One of the nice features of this container is its ability to pull code from a git repository with a couple of environmental variables passed at run time.

**Note:** You need to have your SSH key that you use with git to enable the deployment. I recommend using a special deploy key per project to minimise the risk.

### Preparing your SSH key
The container expects you pass it the __SSH_KEY__ variable with a **base64** encoded private key. First generate your key and then make sure to add it to github and give it write permissions if you want to be able to push code back out the container. Then run:
```
base64 -w 0 /path_to_your_key
```
**Note:** Copy the output be careful not to copy your prompt

To run the container and pull code simply specify the GIT_REPO URL including *git@* and then make sure you have also supplied your base64 version of your ssh deploy key:
```
sudo docker run -d -e 'GIT_REPO=git@git.ngd.io:ngineered/ngineered-website.git' -e 'SSH_KEY=BIG_LONG_BASE64_STRING_GOES_IN_HERE' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```
To pull a repository and specify a branch add the GIT_BRANCH environment variable:
```
sudo docker run -d -e 'GIT_REPO=git@git.ngd.io:ngineered/ngineered-website.git' -e 'GIT_BRANCH=stage' -e 'SSH_KEY=BIG_LONG_BASE64_STRING_GOES_IN_HERE' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```

## Docker-hook

`docker-hook` listens to incoming HTTP requests and triggers your specified command.

It is included in `/usr/bin/docker-hook` 

There is a listener script copied to `/usr/bin/hook-listener` that will auto-start
